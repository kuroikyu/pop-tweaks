# POP TWEAKS

Just an easy way to switch output devices.

I've set up Pop!_OS' custom shortcuts to execute these scripts on `Ctrl` + `PageUp` (speakers) and `Ctrl` + `PageDn` (headphones). If you do this, you should reference the script globally: `/home/your-user/path-to-the-script.sh`

# Requirements

- [PipeWire](https://www.pipewire.org/) 
- [WirePlumber](https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/) aka `wpctl`
